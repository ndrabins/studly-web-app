# Studly Web app

Studly is a web app built to change the way students and teachers communicate with each other. We are creating a platform built for better workflow, organization and learning. 

## Set Up 
```
git clone https://github.com/ndrabins/studly-web-app.git
npm install 
npm start
```

### What we are building Studly with: 
* ReactJS
* Redux - state management
* Firebase - backend as a service

### Technologies: 
* Redux Thunk
* Redux Form (may end up refactoring to react-redux-form, its different I swear. Looks easier to use)
* Material UI v.18
* redux-router-dom
* lodash
* react-quill

# Studly Web app

Studly is a web app built to change the way students and teachers communicate with each other. We are creating a platform built for better workflow, organization and learning. 

### What we are building Studly with: 
* ReactJS
* Redux - state management
* Firebase - backend as a service

### Technologies: 
* Redux Thunk
* Firepad
* Firechat
* Redux Form (may end up refactoring to react-redux-form, its different I swear. Looks easier to use)
* Material UI (Were gonna switch this with custom components or something else. But its quick and easy to prototype with)
